# Artxibition

Converted `https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page294/artxibition` HTML files into Angular project with latest version 15.

# Core points

Made three reusable components which are present in multiple main components:
    -> Navigation bar
    -> Page heading
    -> Tab-options

Made proper use of builtin and structural directives in the application.

Made two different services file:
    -> HTTP service for calling an API
    -> Common service for adding common function which is used in multiple components


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
